The Langley-Hampton Multispectral Polarimeter (**LHMP**) is an atmospgeric polarimeter built with commercial off-the-shelf components (**COTs**). This codebase provides the resources to capture and correct data captured from the LHMP. This is an open-source Python codebase that relies on several other open-source codebases. This codebase relies primarily on harvesters, openCV, and genicam packages to perform the image capture and analysis. Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
